# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


🧠 I built an AI that stalks 8 different apps so I don't have to scroll through them myself
You know that feeling when you're bored but opening Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, and Eventbrite one by one feels like a full-time job? Yeah, I automated that.
Meet my n8n Micro-Adventure Generator – the data-hungry beast that turns your digital chaos into real-world adventures!
🔍 The Data Detective Work:
Every morning at 8 AM, this thing becomes a digital Sherlock Holmes:
* 🌦️ Weather API: "Should humans go outside today?"
* 🏃 Strava: "What segments are people crushing nearby?"
* 📱 Reddit: Scans local subreddits for "Anyone know cool stuff happening?"
* 🐦 Twitter/X: Hunts for event announcements and local buzz
* 📸 Instagram: Gathers local inspiration and hidden gems
* 🎟️ Eventbrite: "What can I actually book right now?"
* 📅 Google Events: Deep-dives via SerpApi for comprehensive coverage
* 💬 Slack: Checks community channels for insider tips
🤖 The Analysis Engine (This is where it gets spicy):
While you're drinking coffee, my automation is cross-referencing weather data with activity types, pattern matching your preferences across platforms, and running scoring algorithms that weigh cost, duration, and weather compatibility. Plus routine-breaking logic that literally says "nope, you did that last week."
Example: Sunny day + Reddit photography walk post + Strava running segment + Instagram food festival = AI suggests outdoor photography walk + food festival combo, auto-books the workshop.
🎯 The Smart Synthesis:
This isn't just data collection – it's intelligent data fusion that provides context awareness for weekend vs workday recommendations, weather intelligence with indoor backup plans, and social proof analysis to find what's actually trending vs just advertised.
🚀 Real-World Results:
Week 1: Found a rooftop pottery class through Reddit that wasn't on any event site Week 2: Discovered a local running group via Strava + Twitter combo Week 3: Booked a food photography workshop by connecting Instagram trends with Eventbrite listings
The magic isn't just finding activities – it's connecting dots across platforms that you'd never manually cross-reference.
💡 Why Data Aggregation + Analysis = Game Changer:
Most people check one app at a time. My automation:
* Scans 8 platforms simultaneously in 30 seconds
* Analyzes patterns across different communities
* Finds hidden connections between fitness, food, and social events
* Predicts what you'll actually enjoy based on multi-source data
The technical truth: It's essentially building a real-time, personalized activity graph from scattered social signals.
🔧 For the Tech Curious:
JavaScript analysis engine processes all collected data with multi-source correlation algorithms, machine learning elements for improved recommendations, and webhook integrations for seamless booking automation.
Currently processing 50+ data points daily from 8 different sources to suggest 3-5 perfectly matched activities.
Who else is using data aggregation to solve everyday problems? The best automations don't just save time – they reveal insights you'd never discover manually.
